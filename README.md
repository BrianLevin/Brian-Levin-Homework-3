- [ ] For this assignment. I had to create a random password generator.
 - [ ] The password needed to include prompts  which gave the user choices for how many characters and the types of characters they wanted in their password.
 - [ ] The random password generator then randomly took the user's choice characters and randomly assigned a series of characters and displayed it on the page.
